# Version 0.5.3
	* Fixed error in fallback `evaluate!` method;

	* Fixed error in execution of patch functions when `FComp` components are involved (#6);

	* The `MultiModelEval{N}` structure (where `N` is the number of models) is now the internal structure used for multi-model evaluation (replaces `Vector{ModelEval}`).

	* The `FitProblem` internal structure is now parametrized on `{M <: AbstractMeasures, T <: AbstractFitStat}`;

# Version 0.5.2
	* Fixed a bug in reporting elapsed time after fitting.

# Version 0.5.1
	* Fixed a bug when evaluating a `SumReducer` component using ForwardDiff.Dual numbers;

	* Some solvers do not handle parameter limits, hence parameter values are checked and possibly adjusted before fitting.  Warning: values are NOT checked during the fitting process, if you need a parameter to respect the allowed range you should use a suitable solver such as LsqFit or CMPFit.

# Version 0.5.0
GModelFit v0.5.0 now supports all solvers from NonlinearSolve, as well as forward mode automatic differentiation via ForwardDiff.
A signficant refactor was needed to accomodate the above functionalities, as well as to improve performance, resulting in a number of breaking changes:

    * Signature of the `evaluate!` functions for component evaluation has changed (this may break your code if you implemented custom components, check `evaluate!` documentation);

    * The `prepare!` function is now supposed to be used just for pre-computing quantities, while the length of the evaluation vector is now provided by the `result_length` function;

	* The solver is now passed as third argument to the `fit` and `fit!` functions (rather than being specified using the `solver=` keyword);

	* The `FitStats` structure is has been replaced by the `FitSummary` one.

# Version 0.4.0
    * Refactored deserialization methods;

# Version 0.3.2
    * Updated docstrings and documentation;

	* Internals: ModelEval is now able to track the changes in the original Model after it has been created;


# Version 0.3.1
    * Updated docstrings

    * Removed unused dependency


# Version 0.3.0
- Breaking Changes:
    * The `Model` constructor no longer accepts a `Domain` argument;

    * The `mock()` function now requires a `Domain` argument;

    * The `fit()` function no longer modifies the provided `Model` argument. The old behaviour is available with the newly added `fit!()` function;

    * The `@Î»` macro has been renamed to `@fd` to remind that the resulting value is a `FunctDesc` structure;

    * Domain objects can no longer be indexed as if they were vectors.  The same functionality is available via the `coords()` or `axis()` functions;

    * The minimizer status is no longer an `Enum`, the same information is now indicated by the corresponding subtypes of `AbstractMinimizerStatus`;


# Version 0.2.1

- New features:
    * Components can now be directly evaluated on a domain by invoking them as function, e.g.
    ```
    comp = GModelFit.Gaussian(1, 0, 1);
    comp(Domain(-5:5))
    ```

- Performance improvements:
    * During a fit the `Model.maincomp` is temporarily set to the main component name.  This allow avoiding unnecessay invocations of `find_maincomp()` during model evaluation;

    * Refactored code in GModelFit.PV


- Bugfix:
    * Fixed a bug in `show()` when a component evaluates to NaN;


# Version 0.2.0

- New features:
    * using PrecompileTools to reduce time-to-first-run in Julia v1.9;

    * Implemented `GModelFit.evalcounter()` to retrieve the number of times a component has been evaluated;

    * Implemented `show()` method for `ModelSnapshot` objects;

    * Refactored serialization code;

- Bugfix:
    * Fixed accessibility issue for parameter of `FCompv`;


# Version 0.1.0
- First release.
