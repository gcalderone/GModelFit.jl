# Multi-dataset fitting

**GFit.jl** is able to simultaneously fit several models against a corresponding number of datasets, while placing constraints among the models. Typical use cases are:
- a single phenomenon is observed with two (or more) instruments/detectors;
- a single phenomenon is observed at different times;

Fitting multiple datasets simultaneously may provide tighter constraints on the best fit parameters under the assumption that the models are somehow related, i.e. that their parameters are constrained (or *patched*).

To perform a multi-dataset fitting we should create one `Model` for each dataset in the usual way, collect them in a `MultiModel` object, and define patch constraints among models.   The following example shows how to fit two Gaussian curves under the hypotesis that the center and normalization parameters are the same:
```@example abc
using GFit

# Create domain, individual models and the MultiModel container
dom = Domain(-5.:5)
model1 = Model(dom, GFit.Gaussian(1, 0., 1.))
model2 = Model(dom, GFit.Gaussian(1, 0., 1.))
multi = MultiModel(model1, model2)

# Patch parameters
multi[2][:main].norm.mpatch   = @Î» m -> m[1][:main].norm
multi[2][:main].center.mpatch = @Î» m -> m[1][:main].center

# Create datasets and fit
data1 = Measures(dom, [-0.006,  0.015,  0.001,  0.049,  0.198,  0.430,  0.226,  0.048,  0.017, -0.001, -0.006], 0.04)
data2 = Measures(dom, [-0.072, -0.033, -0.070,  0.108,  0.168,  0.765,  0.113, -0.054,  0.032,  0.013,  0.015], 0.04)
res = fit!(multi, [data1, data2])
```
